# Air-Quality
This tutorial explains how to set up an air quality sensor (MQ1135) to display its values on an LCD screen using Arduino Uno.

## Parts:
- Gas sensor MQ-135
- Buzzer
- LCD + I2C Backpack
- Arduino Uno
- Jumper wires

## Download and Install:
- Download and install the **Air-Quality zip** file by clicking the green *Clone or Download* button above and selecting *Download ZIP*
- Unzip this file; all the files you'll need will be contained inside
- Unzip the LiquidCrystal_I2C.zip file, and drag the subsequent **LiquidCrystal_I2C-1.1.2 FOLDER** to the Documents/Arduino/libraries folder 
- This will install the necessary library in the Arduino IDE

## Create the Arduino Circuit:
- Open the **AirQuality_bb.pdf** file and follow the visual pinout instructions to create your circuit

## IDE Code
- Double click the **Air-Quality.ino** file, and say yes to the Arduino IDE pop-up window
- The file should open directly in your Arduino IDE application
- Click the Compile button to be sure the code has no bugs, then plug in your Arduino circuit and Upload the code
